# Utilities-Tool
A tool to record utility bills and rent costs shared between two roommates.

To run the tool, run utilities_calculator.py in Python.
If it's your first time running the program, then it will prompt you for the names of the two users before creating a records.db file.
This file will save your name data and all your records.

** At this moment, only rent, gas, water, and electric bills can be recorded.
If there is a problem with the database, try deleting records.db and rerunning the program.
